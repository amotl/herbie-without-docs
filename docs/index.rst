Herbie: Retrieve NWP Model Data
===============================

**Herbie** is a python package that downloads recent and archived numerical weather prediction (NWP) model output from different cloud archive sources. **Its most popular capability is to download HRRR model data.** NWP data in the GRIB2 format can be read with xarray+cfgrib.

Some models Herbie can retrieve data from include:

- High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR)
- Rapid Refresh (RAP)
- Global Forecast System (GFS)
- National Blend of Models (NBM)
- Rapid Refresh Forecast System - Prototype (RRFS)
- ECMWF open data forecast products (ECMWF).
- and others.

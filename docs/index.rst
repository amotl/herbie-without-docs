Herbie: Retrieve NWP Model Data
===============================

**Herbie** is a python package that downloads recent and archived numerical weather prediction (NWP) model output from different cloud archive sources. **Its most popular capability is to download HRRR model data.**

NWP data in GRIB2 format can be read with xarray+cfgrib. Model data Herbie can retrieve includes the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), Rapid Refresh (RAP), Global Forecast System (GFS), National Blend of Models (NBM), Rapid Refresh Forecast System - Prototype (RRFS), and  ECMWF open data forecast products (ECMWF).

===============================
Herbie: Retrieve NWP Model Data
===============================
**Herbie** is a python package that download recent and archived numerical weather prediction (NWP) model output from different cloud archive sources. This data is usually in GRIB2 format and can be read with xarray/cfgrib. Model data Herbie can retrieve includes the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), Rapid Refresh (RAP), Global Forecast System (GFS), National Blend of Models (NBM), and Rapid Refresh Forecast System - Prototype (RRFS).

Install
-------
Herbie requires **Python 3.8+**

Install with pip

.. code:: bash

   pip install hrrrb

   # or

   pip install git+https://github.com/blaylockbk/Herbie.git

To install within a conda environment file, you may use this minimum `environment.yml
<https://github.com/blaylockbk/Herbie/blob/master/environment.yml>`_ file 
and create the environment with the following...

.. code:: bash

   # Create the environment
   conda env create -f environment.yml

   # Update the environment
   conda env update -f environment.yml

   # Activate the environment
   conda activate herbie

Capabilities
------------

Create a Herbie object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Herbie looks for model data at different sources until the requested file is found.

Some of the models Herbie looks for include:

- High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR)
- High Resolution Rapid Refresh - Alaska (HRRRAK)
- Rapid Refresh (RAP)
- Global Forecast System (GFS)
- Global Forecast System - Wave (GFS-Wave)
- Rapid Refresh Forecast System - Prototype (RRFS)
- National Blend of Models (NMB)

This Herbie object is for the HRRR model sfc product and 6 hour forecast. The file was found an Amazon Web Services.

.. code-block:: python

   from herbie.archive import Herbie
   H = Herbie('2021-01-01 12:00', model='hrrr', product='sfc', fxx=6)

Data Sources 
""""""""""""
Thanks to the `NOAA Big Data Program <https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/big-data>`_ weather data is more easily accessible than ever before. Common data sources include

- `NOAA NOMADS Server <https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/>`_ (most recent data, but not archived)
- `Amazon Web Services <https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-hrrr-pds/>`_
- `Google Cloud Platform <https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/noaa-public/hrrr>`_
- `Microsoft Azure <https://github.com/microsoft/AIforEarthDataSets/blob/main/data/noaa-hrrr.md>`_
- `University of Utah Pando Archive <http://hrrr.chpc.utah.edu/>`_

Download Model Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the Herbie object we created above, this downloads the full GRIB2 file to your local machine.

.. code-block:: python

   H.download()

.. image:: _static/screenshots/usage_2.png

Download a subset
"""""""""""""""""
**Subsetting GRIB files by GRIB message** is also supported, provided that an index (.idx) file exists. For more information about subsetting, read :ref:`What is GRIB2? <GRIB2_FAQ>`.

Using the Herbie object we created above, we can retrieve all fields at 500 mb.

.. code-block:: python

   # Download all fields at 500 mb level
   H.download(':500 mb')

.. image:: _static/screenshots/usage_3.png

Read GRIB2 Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Herbie can help you read these files with `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_ via `cfgrib <https://github.com/ecmwf/cfgrib>`_.

.. code-block:: python

   # Open 2-m Temperature field
   H.xarray('TMP:2 m')

.. image:: _static/screenshots/usage_4.png

Plot Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^
üèó Under construction. I want to make some useful xarray accessors for plotting the GRIB2 fields. This will use tools I am developing in my `Carpenter Workshop <https://github.com/blaylockbk/Carpenter_Workshop>`_ package to plot the data on a Cartopy map or pluck points nearest specific latitudes and longitudes.

Bulk Download
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sometimes you need lots of data. Herbie can help download many files for a range of dates and forecast lead times. For example,

.. code-block:: python

   from herbie.tools import bulk_download
   import pandas as pd

   # Download HRRR analysis for every hour of a day
   DATES = pd.date_range('2021-01-01 00:00', '2021-01-01 06:00', freq='1H')
   bulk_download(DATES, model='hrrr', product='sfc', fxx=0, searchString='TMP:2 m')

Other Tools
-----------
**üõ∞ GOES ABI and GLM** data can be downloaded from AWS with my `goes-2-go <https://github.com/blaylockbk/goes2go/tree/master/goes2go>`_ package. This package was also originally developed during grad school and has been updated.

**üå° Synoptic API (MesoWest)** data can be retrieved with my `SynopticPy <https://github.com/blaylockbk/goes2go/tree/master/SynopticPy>`_ package, also originally developed during grad school and has been updated.

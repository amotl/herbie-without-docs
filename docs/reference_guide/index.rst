There are currently two APIs. The old HRRR-B API still exists, but is not receiving any attention. The Herbie API is new and most likely to be developed in the future. I've learned a few things about Python classes and xarray accessors that I am using in Herbie that I didn't know when I wrote HRRR-B.

# 👨🏻‍🏭 Contributing Guidelines (and disclaimer)

The intent of this package is to serve as an _example_ of how you can download archvied HRRR data, but it still might be useful for you. 

Since this package is a work in progress, it is distributed "as is." I do not make any guarantee it will work for you out of the box. In fact, this is my first experience publishing a package to PyPI. Any revisions I make are purely for my benefit. Sorry if I break something, but I usually only push updates to GitHub if the code is in a reasonably functional state (at least, in the way I use it).

With that said, I am happy to share this project with you. You are welcome to open issues and submit pull requests, but know that I may or may not get around to doing anything about it. If this is helpful to you in any way, I'm glad.

> ## What if I don't like this package?
> As an alternative, you can use [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to download HRRR files from cloud platforms. I quite like rclone. Here is a [short rclone tutorial](https://github.com/blaylockbk/pyBKB_v3/blob/master/rclone_howto.md)

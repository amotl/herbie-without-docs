Herbie continues to evolve and is distributed _as is_. I do not make any guarantee it will work for you out of the box or is tailored to your needs. Honestly, this package is my playground for developing my python skills and testing new ideas in my free time.

With that said, I am happy to share this project with you. If this is helpful to you in any way, I'm glad.

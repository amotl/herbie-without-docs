History
===============
**👨🏻‍🎓 During my PhD at the University of Utah**, I created, at the time, the only publicly-accessible archive of HRRR data. Over 1,000 research scientists and professionals used that archive. In the later half of 2020, the HRRR data was made available through the `NOAA Big Data Program <https://www.noaa.gov/information-technology/big-data>`_. The Herbie package organizes and expands my original download scripts into a more coherent package with the extended ability to download more than just the HRRR and RAP model data and from different data sources. It will continue to evolve at my own leisure.

✒ I wrote a paper about archiving HRRR data in the cloud
    Blaylock B., J. Horel and S. Liston, 2017: Cloud Archiving and Data Mining of High Resolution Rapid Refresh Model Output. Computers and Geosciences. 109, 43-50. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2017.08.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2017.08.005)

**🌹 What's in a name?** I originally released this package under the name "HRRR-B" because it only dealt with the HRRR data set and the "B" is for my initial. Since then, I have added the ability to download RAP, GFS, NBM, RRFS, and potentially more models in the future. Also, there is an archive of HRRR data in Zarr format, and Herbie could potentially be used to download that format. Thus, it was re-branded with the name "Herbie," named after a favorite childhood movie. For now, it is still called "hrrrb" on PyPI because "herbie" is already taken.

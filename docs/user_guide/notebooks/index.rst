HRRR Zarr
^^^^^^^^^

Select parts of the HRRR archive are available in `Zarr <https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ format in the ``s3://hrrrzarr`` bucket on AWS developed by `Taylor Gowan <https://twitter.com/tayloragowan>`_ and managed by the MesoWest group at the University of Utah. To get started check out these notebooks:

- `Taylor Gowan: HRRR-Zarr examples <https://github.com/taylorgowan/zarr>`_
- `Kevin Tyle: HRRR-Zarr AMS Short Course <https://github.com/ktyle/python_pangeo_ams2021/blob/main/notebooks/03_Pangeo_HRRR.ipynb>`_

I haven't added Zarr functionality into `Herbie`, but I started to explore the capability. Here is my sandbox notebook...

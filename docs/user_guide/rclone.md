# ðŸ¤– Rclone

If you just need to download files from the cloud, I will direct you to [rclone](https://rclone.org/). I love rclone! Below is a brief tutorial to help you get started.

As part of NOAA's Big Data Project, the NEXRAD radar, GOES satellite, HRRR model, and other dataset are publicly available via Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use `rclone` to access these datasets and download. (You can even use rclone to access personal OneDrive, Google Drive, Box, and other types of cloud storage.)

# Install and Setup

## 1. Download and install `rclone` on your linux machine

Download from https://rclone.org/downloads/ or install with conda.

    conda install -c conda-forge rclone

## 2. Configure `rclone` to access **Amazon S3**
After `rclone` has been downloaded and installed, configure a remote by typing `rclone config`. Then type `n` for `new remote`.

Name the remote anything you like, but use a name that will remind you it accesses the public Amazon S3 buckets. I named mine `publicAWS`. 

Set _Type of Storage_ as `Amazon S3 Compliant Storage Providers`

Set _Storage Provider_ as `Amazon Web Services S3`.

Leave everything else blank (push enter for the remaining prompts).

The prompt will ask you if something like following is correct:

    [publicAWS]
    type = s3
    provider = AWS
    env_auth =
    access_key_id =
    secret_access_key =
    region =
    endpoint =
    location_constraint =
    acl =
    server_side_encryption =
    storage_class =

If it looks right, accept with `y` and exit the setup.

This configuration is saved in the `~/.config/rclone.config` file.

# CLI Usage

You will use the remote you just configured to access NOAA's public buckets on Amazon Web Services S3. Below are the names of some of NOAA's public buckets. 

| Data   | Bucket Name          |                                         |
| ------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| GOES16 | `noaa-goes16`        | [documentation](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-goes/)     |
| GOES17 | `noaa-goes17`        | [documentation](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-goes/)     |
| NEXRAD | `noaa-nexrad-level2` | [documentation](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-nexrad/)   |
| HRRR   | `noaa-hrrr-bdp-pds`  | [documentation](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-hrrr-pds/) |

> Note: **bdp-pds** stands for Big Data Program Public Data Set

You access the bucket contents by typing the command

    rclone <command> <options> <remoteName>:<bucket>
    
Documentation for all the commands and options can be found on the [rclone](https://rclone.org/) website.

List bucket directories

```bash
rclone lsd publicAWS:noaa-goes16/
```
List bucket directories for specific folders
```bash
rclone lsd publicAWS:noaa-hrrr-bdp-pds/hrrr.20210101
```
List files in bucket
```bash
rclone ls publicAWS:noaa-hrrr-bdp-pds/hrrr.20210101/conus
```

Copy file or files to your local machine

```bash
rclone copy publicAWS:noaa-goes16/ABI-L2-MCMIPC/2018/283/00/OR_ABI-L2-MCMIPC-M3_G16_s20182830057203_e20182830059576_c20182830100076.nc ./
```

ðŸª‚ Subset with ``searchString``
================================

Subsetting is done using the GRIB2 index files. Index files define the grib variables/parameters of each message (sometimes it is useful to think of a grib message as a "layer" of the file) and define the byte range of the message.

Herbie can subset a file by grib message by downloading a byte range of the file. This way, instead of downloading the full file, you can download just the "layer" of the file you want. The searchString method implemented in Herbie to do a partial download is similar to what is explained here: https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/fast_downloading_grib.html


Herbie supports reading two different types of index files

1. Index files output by the **wgrib2** command-line utility. These index files are common for forecast models provided by **NCEP**.
2. Index files output by the **grib_ls** command-line utlity. These index files are common for forecast models provided by **ECMWF**.

You can use regular expression to search for lines in the index file. If ``H`` is a Herbie object, the regex search is performed on the ``H.read_idx().search_this`` column of the DataFrame


If you need help with regular expression, search the web or look at this `cheatsheet <https://www.petefreitag.com/cheatsheets/regex/>`_. Check regular expressions with `regexr <https://regexr.com/>`_ or `regex101 <https://regex101.com/>`_.


wgrib2-style index files
------------------------
Here are some examples you can use for the ``searchString`` argument for the **wgrib2**-style index files.

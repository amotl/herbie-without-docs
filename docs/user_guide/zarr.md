Select parts of the HRRR archive are available in [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) format in the `s3://hrrrzarr` bucket on AWS developed by [Taylor Gowan](https://twitter.com/tayloragowan) and managed by the MesoWest group at the University of Utah. *Herbie doesn't download this type of data yet*, but it might in the future.
